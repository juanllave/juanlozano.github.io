Profesional and team player. Great leadership skills. I constantly askied his point of views in different projects because he always had a different way to do the things. Very valuable person.

I can say JUan is one of those persons that makes someone feel like they are worth. As his boss, he always demonstrated interest and disnguished himself for his capacity to solve complex problems. He is fast learner who always comes up with new ideas and ways to tackle issues.
