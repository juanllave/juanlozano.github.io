### Respect
This is the foundation for healthy relationships. I lead my life in a conscious manner of other people's needs.

### Empathy and Compassion
Empathy is being able to feel for others. Compassion is taking the appropriate action, being kind and considerate.

### Fairness
What we do takes time and effort. Be mindful of it.

### Diversity
Plurality is the future. Let's hear aknowledge our differences to grow stronger. 

### Equity
Similar to fairness, equity is being considerate and conscious of the effort and the care that goes into the work we do.

### Inclusion
Inclusion, not integration. Accomodation, not segregation. Consideration, not pitty.
