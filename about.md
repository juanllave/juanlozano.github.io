I organize and arrange loose ideas and connect them into articulated, structured concepts and full strategies with clear parts, frames, and timelines.

I am energetic, responsible, and self-motivated. I have great organizing and prioritizing skills. I am an effective multi-tasker, capable of efficiently handling multiple projects at once and deliver on time and within budget.

I am fluent in Spanish and English. I have degrees in Communications and Political Sociology.
