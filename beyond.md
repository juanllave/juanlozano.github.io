I like the cold. I like mountains, being near them, running or climbing them. I love small, well-connected, walkable, people-friendly cities. I am a localist. I am certain that big structures become disconnected with its users and its people. I believe in people, in communities. I am convinced that we still have time and there is still hope. I am a proponent of devolution, the dismantling of big-everything, in order to refocus people at the centre of societies.
